# Medication-Access-Made-Easy-A-Location-Based-Solution-for-Real-Time-Drug-Availability
Abstract—This README presents a novel web-based platform
designed to enhance access to essential medications through realtime location-based availability checks. The platform enables
users to locate nearby pharmacies that have specific drugs in
stock by entering the medication name and their geographic
location. Our solution addresses the critical need for timely
medication access during emergencies by leveraging advanced
geolocation services and a robust database system. The system
not only facilitates immediate access to vital medications but
also promotes transparency within the healthcare ecosystem by
providing real-time data on drug availability. Furthermore, the
platform includes a recommendation engine that suggests alternative medications when the desired drugs are out of stock. By
offering a comprehensive, user-friendly interface, our platform
significantly improves public health outcomes by ensuring quick
and informed decisions regarding medication procurement.
